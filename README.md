When you click on it, the current query being executed will be exported.

Any file ending in *.csv will be automatically imported, generated one transaction per line.

If you want more control over the exported data format, please consider using our [Google Sheets Add-on](https://bkper.com/apps/bkper-sheets), so you can fetch data from your books, work on it and export in many formats.
